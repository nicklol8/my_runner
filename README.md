# Donut Dash
Donut Dash is an infinite runner game, made in Phaser. It was a very fun challenge, and really tested my ability to read docs and problem solve on my own. Includes a rails backend using sql to keep track of the leaderboard!

## Approach
I started following a few tutorials on how Phaser works and to get a feel for developing the game. After getting to a point where I felt comfortable, I started changing things to figure out how it all goes down! After getting the game working, I worked on creating my backend, using Rails. As my first experience with Rails it was a little different from Express, but made easier using scaffolding. 

## Future Additions
Given more time, I would like to have a user be able to log in and have the scoreboard update their high score automatically, instead of a user having to manually submit it. I would also like to add more levels, and possibly make the platforms speed up as time goes on
